    <p class="paragraph">Saving and serving the cats of Santa Barbara County since 1989.
         Our mission at ASAP Cats is to provide shelter, veterinary care, behavioral support, adopter and foster services, feline education, and community outreach.
          We’re here to support cats and cat families, as well as to reduce the overpopulation of stray, unsocial, and unhoused cats.
           Through various feline-centric programs and monthly adoption events and yard sales, it is our goal to help every local cat we meet.

        Our shelter is currently open Monday—Friday from 1—4pm, as well as Saturdays from 11am—3pm.
         We also accept appointments, just give us a call at (805) 683-3368 to schedule one.
